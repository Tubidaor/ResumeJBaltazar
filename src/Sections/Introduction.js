      <p>
        Thank you for taking the time to read this.
        I am attempting to change careers.
        I've been an accountant (CPA) for the last 12 years.
        My favorite part of being an accountant was to play with VBA and excel.
        I love coding, and I am willing to put in the work. I just need a chance.
